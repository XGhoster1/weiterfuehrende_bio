1. The initial drop is likely due to random weight intialization.
The model in the beginning is learning and has bias
from the first training iterations so it fluctuates randomly.
As it begins to learn to fit the data, it may overfit before
becoming more able to recognize general data.

2. The model has two hidden layers, therefore it is capable
of "learning" nonlinear decisions. The input is 2D and the output
binary, so it should be curved or concentric decision boundaries.
